Hey! Since you're reading this, I'd love to tell you something about me.<br/>
I'm a 14 year old student from Italy who loves programming in Java, C++, Python, ecc...<br/>
I'm not really experienced, but we all have to start from somewhere.<br/>
If you need someone to collaborate with, I'd be really interested (two people can do better than one)<br/>
<br/><br/>
P.S: Even thought I'm Italian, I can speak English quite well.
